    "## Particle Filter Details\n",
    "In localization tasks we are attempting to estimate the state variable of a robot, in this case it's 2D position in the map coordinate system and it's orientation with respect to the map coordinate x-axis. Under the Markov Model assumption, the current state of a robot $x_t$ at step $t$, only depends on the previous time step state $x_{t-1}$, control variables $u_t$, and environmental observations $z_t$, we express this state belief as a probability distribution function (pdf) given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\rm bel}(x_t) = P(x_t|x_{t-1},u_t,z_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note I am using the same notation as \"Probabilistic Robotics\" - Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, Dieter Fox) The estimation process proceeds in a two step fashion, first evolve your previous state under a noisy motion model given the control variables described by the function below,\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_t = f(x_{t-1},u_t) + \\epsilon_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\epsilon_t$ is a random variable capturing the imprecise actuation of the control command $u_t$, and has zero mean.  When we convolve this motion model in our belief we end up with a state pdf given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\hat{x}_t|u_t) = \\int P_{\\rm motion}\\left[\\hat{x}_t-f(x_{t-1},u_t)\\right]{\\rm bel}(x_{t-1}) dx_{t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, $P_{\\rm motion}\\left[\\hat{x}_t-f(x_{t-1},u_t)\\right]$ is the probabilistic model for the actuation noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampled vs Parametric Models\n",
    "We can go one further approximation level and rather than storing the distribution information in a function ${\\rm bel}(x_t)$ which might be approximated by a Gaussian for a Kalman filter, where the task is to estimate the Gaussian parameters (the mean and covariance), we can approximate the function by a kernel density estimator, \n",
    "\n",
    "${\\rm bel}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\phi(x|x^n)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_t^n \\sim {\\rm bel}(x_t)$, and $\\phi(x|x_t)$ is a normalized kernel function which is centered about $x_t$.  What we're doing in this case is trading a parametric estimation of ${\\rm bel}(x_t)$ for an approximation that is contained in the evolution of the samples $x^n$ known as the particles of the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining this approximation method (sampling), the predict step requires us to sample from $P(\\hat{x}_t|u_t)=\\overline{{\\rm bel}}(\\hat{x}_t)$. This can be done by evolving each of the particles $x^n_t$ under $f(x_{t-1},u_t)$ and sampling the actuation noise and summing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is rectifying environment measurements $z_t$ with the state estimate from the prediction step, ie we we need to sample the pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\rm bel}(x_t)=P(x_t|z_t)= P(z_t|x_t)P(x_t)/P(z_t) \\propto P(z_t|x_t)P(x_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take $P(x_t) = \\overline{{\\rm bel}}(x_t)$ in the above.  Sampling this distribution can be done via importance sampling against the particle states which come from $\\overline{{\\rm bel}}(x_t)$. This means each particle receives a weight proportional to $P(z_t|x_t)$. In this example problem we model the sensor uncertainty as Gaussian noise where each observation is independent of the others thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(z_t|x_t) = \\prod_{m=1}^{M_t} N(z^m_t|x_t,\\sigma)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "for $M_t$ observations at step $t$.  Once the weights $w^m$ are computed for each particle $m$, we resample the particles with replacement with probability of selection proportional to the $w^m$.  This results in a sampling of ${\\rm bel}(x_t)$ and the process repeats.\n",
