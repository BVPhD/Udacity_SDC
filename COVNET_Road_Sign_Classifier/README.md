## Project: Traffic Sign Recognition Convolutional Nerual Network
Part of the [![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, we are given a data set of  51,839  samples of  32Ã—32  labeled RGB images of German traffic signs which can be found here, [[(German Traffic Sign Dataset)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)]. Our goal in this project is to build, train, and analyze an image classifier inspired by the LeNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. ln this program I perform data exploration, where I try to find some useful preprocessing steps that allows one to extract more useful features for classification, artificially generate additional image samples through image transformations in order to vastly expand our dataset, build a tensorflow CNN model, tune the model hyper-parameters, analyze the classifier operating characteristics, and finally examine the model filters that are generated from the training of the CNN. Many parts of this notebook are inspired by [[Alex Staravoitau's work](https://navoshta.com/traffic-signs-classification/)] and his suggested architecture and regularization techniques, and I highly recommend viewing his work. The work of [[Pierre Sermanet and Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf)] is also key to finding features which work best for this task.  

Ultimately I ended up generating 430,000 training samples using the L-channel of the HLS color space images, with some preprocessing steps as input to a 3 layer 5x5 covolutional net (32-64-128 filters) where each layer feeds into the next layer and into a concatanated flattened vector as the input to a fully connected layer, and ultimately to a logit layer.  With this architecture I found 0.999 training accuracy, 0.947 validation accuracy, and 0.957 test accuracy.  The details of this network and its analyis is found within, Enjoy.
