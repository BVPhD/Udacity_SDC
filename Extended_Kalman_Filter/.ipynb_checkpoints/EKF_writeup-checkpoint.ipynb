    "# Implementing an Extended Kalman Filter\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is implemented in C++ code, to estimate s 2D position $(p_x,p_y)$ and 2D velocity $(v_x,v_y)$, state of a car of where noisy LIDAR and RADAR measurements are sequentially observed.  The EKF sequentially takes measurements, integrates the measurements with a previous state likelihood to give maximum likelihood estimates of the state of the object, as well as related uncertainties, under the assumption of Gaussian noise in each measurement, and each forward step in the evolution of the car's true position. In this write up I will review the theory of the EKF, describe an initialization method for the first likelihood belief, discuss code implementation in C++ and review some of the short comings of the implementation.\n",

    "### Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "The EKF is a two step process, a prediction step and an observation step. In the prediction step we assume a previous prior belief pdf $P(\\bar{x}_{t-1})$ for the true state vector $\\bar{x}_{t-1}$ and evolve it forward a step $\\delta t$ by application of the evolution formula $f(x_{t-1})$ as well as integrating process noise for the given step.  This results in a posterior belief of the true state after evolution which is given by  $P(x_t)$ to be derived below.  The beauty of the EKF is that we assume the initial prior state belief is Gaussian.  This leads to a chain of Gaussian priors and posteriors and allows a simple update rule for predictions and measurements. How to initialize the expected state and covariance matrix for the seed prior is left to a later section.  Below I derive the result for the distribution of $x_t$ after evolution of the prior state $\\bar{x}_{t-1}$.  Note I use over bars to help segregate algorithmic steps but it bares no importance other than notation.\n",

When we have a single measurement, be it RADAR or LIDAR, we can only set the point of maximum likelihood of the initial Gaussian, ie the mean value, to the value measured, $p_x=z_x, \\ p_y = z_y$.  When we have an initial LIDAR measurement there is no information about the initial velocities and there is no way to determine any velocity information without a second observation. When our initial measurement is given by a radar measurement, we can similarly compute $p_x = r \\cos(\\phi), \\ p_y = r \\sin(\\phi)$, but we can not uniquely determine the initial velocity values that are consistent with the initial measurement $\\dot{r}$.  If you have additional information about orientation or possible directions the object can move, that can be used to determine optimal $v_x, v_y$ values with the relationship $\\cos(\\phi) v_x + \\sin(\\phi) v_y = \\dot{r}$, but in general we must use the second observation, to set the initial estimate $v_x,v_y$.  The Kalman predict+update loop is done for every observation but by flagging the second observation value, we can set the initial $\\bar{\\mu}_0$ prior to executing the prediction step by\n",

In the model we used for each evolutionary step, we assume that the velocity is fixed for that time step, thus for each time the vehicle turns we will always over estimate a larger turn radius than is actually taken by the object of interest.  By using different motion models we can improve the error induced by this assumption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second largest short coming is by the assumption that large deviations from the mean values of the pdfs used do not contribute to the integrals used in the computations.  This is especially not true during the initialization of the pdf values, and also for non-linear functions $h(x_t)$, this can be especially false.  Methods to find better approximations of the true posterior functions but while retaining Gaussian forms have been created and an especially popular one is known as Unscented Kalman Filtering."
