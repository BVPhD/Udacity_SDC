# Udacity Self Driving Car Nano-degree Program

Within this repository contains all my work as part of the self-driving car nano-degree as offered by Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). While the data and project ideas are provided by Udacity the work and write ups are my own and serve as a demonstration of experience in working with classical computer vision, convolutional nerual networks, deep learning, programming experience in python, sci-kit learn, tensorflow, keras, opencv, and use of cloud based notebooks (as all of training of networks was done on GPU enabled cloud based instances).  I really enjoyed creating these projects and attempted to make my write us as accessable as possible, enjoy.

Note: the notebooks render best when viewed in a Jupyter notebook session [(jupyter notebook viewer)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
